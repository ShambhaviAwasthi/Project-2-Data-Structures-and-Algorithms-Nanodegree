Problem 3: Dutch national Flag Problem
Given an input array consisting on only 0, 1, and 2, sort the array in a single traversal. You're not allowed to use any sorting function that Python provides.
Note: O(n) does not necessarily mean single-traversal. For e.g. if you traverse the array twice, that would still be an O(n) solution but it will not count as single traversal.

Analysis:
I created three lists to store 0,1 and 2 respectively and later merge them together to give output list. Space complexity of the code is the length of input and time complexity is O(n).

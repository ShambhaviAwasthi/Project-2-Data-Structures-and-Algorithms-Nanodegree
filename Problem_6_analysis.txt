Problem 6: Max and Min in a Unsorted Array
In this problem, we will look for smallest and largest integer from a list of unsorted integers. The code should run in O(n) time. Do not use Python's inbuilt functions to find min and max.
Bonus Challenge: Is it possible to find the max and min in a single traversal?

Analysis: In my code using single traversal of the array I found the min and max in an unsorted array. Time complexity of the code is O(n) and space complexity is O(1) as it returns two pointers.
